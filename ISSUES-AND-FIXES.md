# Current Issues and Fixes

## Summary of Issues

Based on the Render logs and testing, here are the issues:

### ✅ RESOLVED
1. **JavaScript URLs fixed** - All hardcoded `localhost:3001` URLs changed to relative paths
2. **Login working** - Authentication successfully logs you in
3. **Page navigation working** - All pages load correctly
4. **Member data working** - Transactions fetch successfully

### ❌ REMAINING ISSUES

#### 1. Missing Database Tables (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Render database is incomplete - missing `change_requests` table and possibly others.

**Evidence from logs:**
```
Error fetching change request count: error: relation "change_requests" does not exist
```

**Impact:**
- Dashboard can't fetch change request counts
- Analytics might fail if data tables are missing
- Some features completely non-functional

**Fix:** Import complete schema to Render database
```powershell
# Get your External Database URL from Render dashboard
psql "YOUR_EXTERNAL_DB_URL" -f imvcmpc/auth/schema.sql
```

See `RENDER-DATABASE-SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

#### 2. Button Functionality Issues
**Problem:** Login button and show/hide password button not responding to clicks

**Evidence:**
- User has to press Enter to login instead of clicking the button
- Password visibility toggle button not working

**Possible causes:**
1. **Browser caching old JavaScript** - Most likely cause
2. **JavaScript errors in console** - Need to check browser console
3. **CSP (Content Security Policy) blocking inline event handlers** - Helmet middleware might be too strict

**Fixes to try:**

**A. Clear browser cache (try this first):**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache completely
- Or try in Incognito/Private mode

**B. Check browser console for errors:**
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Look for JavaScript errors (red text)
- Screenshot and share any errors you see

**C. If CSP is blocking (check console for CSP errors):**
We may need to update the Helmet configuration in `server.js`:
```javascript
app.use(helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
        directives: {
            defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
            scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],  // Allow inline event handlers
            styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com", "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com"],
            fontSrc: ["'self'", "https://fonts.gstatic.com", "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com"],
            imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:"]
        }
    }
}));
```

#### 3. Dashboard and Analytics Not Fetching Data
**Problem:** Dashboard and analytics pages not showing data

**Root cause:** Likely the missing database tables issue (#1)

**What happens:**
- Frontend calls `/api/auth/analytics/summary`
- Backend tries to query non-existent tables
- Returns error or empty data
- Dashboard shows ₱0.00 for everything

**Fix:** Same as #1 - import complete schema

---

#### 4. Filter Buttons Not Functional
**Problem:** Filter buttons on various pages not working

**Root cause:** Likely same as button issue (#2) - JavaScript event listeners not attaching

**Fix:** Same as #2 - clear cache and check console

---

## Priority Order

### HIGH PRIORITY (Do these first):

1. **Import complete schema to Render database**
   - Follow `RENDER-DATABASE-SETUP.md`
   - This should fix dashboard/analytics data issues
   - Will also fix change_requests errors in logs

2. **Clear browser cache / Test in incognito**
   - This should fix button functionality issues
   - Test in incognito mode to confirm

3. **Check browser console for errors**
   - Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
   - Look for red error messages
   - Screenshot and share any errors

### MEDIUM PRIORITY:

4. **Test each page systematically after fixes**
   - Login page - button should work
   - Dashboard - should show data
   - Member Data - should show transactions (already working)
   - Analytics - should show charts and data
   - All filters should work

### LOW PRIORITY:

5. **Update CORS settings for production**
   - Currently allows localhost origins
   - Should be updated to include Render URL

## Testing Checklist

After importing database schema and clearing cache:

- [ ] Login button works (no need to press Enter)
- [ ] Show/hide password button works
- [ ] Dashboard shows correct data (not ₱0.00)
- [ ] Analytics page loads charts with data
- [ ] Member Data page loads (already working)
- [ ] Filters work on all pages
- [ ] No errors in browser console (F12)
- [ ] No errors in Render logs related to missing tables

---

## Next Steps

1. Import schema using the commands in `RENDER-DATABASE-SETUP.md`
2. Clear browser cache or test in incognito mode
3. Test the application and report:
   - What's working now?
   - What's still not working?
   - Any error messages in browser console?
